# update-notifier
a telegram bot that will send updates to a channel whenever an update has been released for an app store app. apps are checked for updates every 20 minutes. **this bot will rely on files saved to your local filesystem**, however they will be stored in `~/.config/updateNotifier/` so they are not visible.
